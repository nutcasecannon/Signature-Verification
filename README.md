Offline Signature Verification Using CNN inspired by InceptionV1
[Reference Research Paper : DOI:10.1109/ICIIP47207.2019.8985925]

This methodology for offline handwritten signature verification utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) inspired by the Inception V1 (GoogleNet) architecture. The model adopts a writer-independent approach, treating genuine and forged signatures as distinct classes.
